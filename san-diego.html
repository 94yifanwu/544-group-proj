            <p class="lead">If you want to experience the beautiful seaside scenery, experience all kinds of water activities, and at the same time want an entertaining travel experience, you can choose San Diego as a place! San Diego is a very special city in Southern California. It was once ruled by Spain and is very close to neighboring Mexico. Therefore, it is filled with a strong exotic atmosphere and deeply fascinating.</p>
            <p>This place is like Kinder's Surprising Egg, which can satisfy several wishes of everyone at once! You can eat delicious food, spend a holiday by the sea, play on the beach during the day, and enjoy the night view of San Diego at night. There are also many museums and cultural and artistic areas to visit. If you like theme parks, Ocean World and Legoland can also satisfy you. In short, San Diego is suitable for family trips, big friends and children can have fun! Today, let’s have a good time with everyone in San Diego and feel its different beauty!</p>

            <p>San Diego is the second largest city in California, about a 2-hour drive from Los Angeles. It is located at the southern tip of California, on the border of the United States and Mexico, and its unique geographical environment also makes it a naval base + resort. The blue sky, brilliant sunshine, pleasant climate, coupled with the scenic coastline, make many friends who live in Los Angeles can't help running here on holidays!
            </p>

            <p>At the end of the Second World War, the Midway Island, which has experienced numerous historical battles, large and small, ended its 47-year mission after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991. In 2004, it was transformed into a museum and opened to the public.</p>

            <p>The museum is equipped with maps and audio guides. Starting from the deck, you can visit aircraft engines, machinery rooms, confinement rooms, etc., and see the crew’s living places, such as restaurants, kitchens, laundry rooms, medical rooms and post offices. Because there is everything. In addition, fighter jets and helicopters are also displayed on the flight deck, which is impressive with the view of San Diego Bay. Coronado is a charming holiday island, like a sea paradise surrounded by beaches. The beach here has great soft yarn quality, and Hotel Del Coronado on the island is also one of the must-visit attractions.</p>

            <p>The hotel was built in 1888. In the past, many political and business celebrities have stayed there, and many American TV movies have also come here for shooting. 12 of the US presidents alone have visited here, which shows how high the style of this hotel is. I recommend everyone to visit Coronado Island. You can choose to have a brunch in the hotel, explore the island by bicycle, visit Orange Avenue, and stroll on the white sand beach. It is especially pleasant!</p>
