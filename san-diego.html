            <p class="lead">If you want to experience the beautiful seaside scenery, experience all kinds of water activities, and at the same time want an entertaining travel experience, you can choose San Diego as a place! San Diego is a very special city in Southern California. It was once ruled by Spain and is very close to neighboring Mexico. Therefore, it is filled with a strong exotic atmosphere and deeply fascinating.
            </p>
            <p>This place is like Kinder's Surprising Egg, which can satisfy several wishes of everyone at once! You can eat delicious food, spend a holiday by the sea, play on the beach during the day, and enjoy the night view of San Diego at night. There are also many museums and cultural and artistic areas to visit. If you like theme parks, Ocean World and Legoland can also satisfy you. In short, San Diego is suitable for family trips, big friends and children can have fun! Today, let’s have a good time with everyone in San Diego and feel its different beauty!
            </p>
            <h4>How to get to San Diego</h4>
            <p>San Diego is the second largest city in California, about a 2-hour drive from Los Angeles. It is located at the southern tip of California, on the border of the United States and Mexico, and its unique geographical environment also makes it a naval base + resort. The blue sky, brilliant sunshine, pleasant climate, coupled with the scenic coastline, make many friends who live in Los Angeles can't help running here on holidays!
            </p>
            <h4>Where to Stay</h4>
            <p>Downtown San Diego (Little Italy, The Gaslamp, and Seaport Village) is a very convenient area to call home base for travelers. It’s just a few minutes from the airport and a great option for anyone interested in visiting Balboa Park, attending a Padres game, as well as those looking for nightlife and some of the top restaurants in the city. Downtown is fairly small and if staying here, it is quite easy to forgo a rental car (and the hefty nightly parking fee) and simply walk or take a trolley or an Uber. You’ll find mostly 4-star and 5-star hotels in the Gaslamp and near Horton Plaza, smaller boutique hotels in Little Italy, and high-rise chain hotels in Seaport Village. Seaport village is a great choice for families staying in San Diego who want to be near downtown. The other areas of downtown are a better choice for an adult getaway.
            </p>
            <p>Coronado is directly across from downtown San Diego and can be reached by ferry or by the beautiful and impressive Coronado bridge. It is home to the Hotel Del Coronado, the most famous and best beachfront resort in San Diego. Coronado is great for families and anyone looking for a beach vacation.
            </p>
            <h4>What to Do in San Diego</h4>
            <p>Gaslamp: The heart of the City of San Diego and hub for nightlife and dining.
              Little Italy: A chic, pedestrian-friendly neighborhood, packed with trendy restaurants, creative cocktail bars, gastropubs, and coffee shops.
            </p>
            <p>Balboa Park-Hillcrest: Home of the famous San Diego Zoo and museums. Hillcrest is known for being an affluent, bohemian, and LGBTQ-friendly community.
              Old Town-Mission Valley: Historic area and location of first Spanish settlement in California. There’s also a bus, trolley and coaster depot located right next to it.
            </p>
            <h4>3 Days Itenerary
            </h4>
            <h5>Day 1</h5>
            <p>At the end of the Second World War, the Midway Island, which has experienced numerous historical battles, large and small, ended its 47-year mission after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991. In 2004, it was transformed into a museum and opened to the public.
            </p>
            <div class="ftco-blocks-cover-1">
              <div class="site-section-cover " data-stellar-background-ratio="0.5" style="background-image: url('images/downtown.jpg')">
              </div>
              <p></p>
            <p>The museum is equipped with maps and audio guides. Starting from the deck, you can visit aircraft engines, machinery rooms, confinement rooms, etc., and see the crew’s living places, such as restaurants, kitchens, laundry rooms, medical rooms and post offices. Because there is everything. In addition, fighter jets and helicopters are also displayed on the flight deck, which is impressive with the view of San Diego Bay.</p>
            <h5>Day 2</h5>
            <p>Coronado is a charming holiday island, like a sea paradise surrounded by beaches. The beach here has great soft yarn quality, and Hotel Del Coronado on the island is also one of the must-visit attractions.
            </p>
            <p>The hotel was built in 1888. In the past, many political and business celebrities have stayed there, and many American TV movies have also come here for shooting. 12 of the US presidents alone have visited here, which shows how high the style of this hotel is. I recommend everyone to visit Coronado Island. You can choose to have a brunch in the hotel, explore the island by bicycle, visit Orange Avenue, and stroll on the white sand beach. It is especially pleasant!
            </p>

            </div>
              <p></p>
            <h5>Day 3</h5>
            <p>The San Diego Zoo is one of the largest zoos in the world and has the most advanced management facilities in the world. Due to the vast area, visitors have to take a bus to visit the park. The bus is divided into two floors, and you can have a sweeping view of the endless wild scenery around. It should be noted that the bus does not pass through the most popular "Panda Zone" in the park. Because the exhibition is located in the center of the zoo, you must take your legs. Only by walking can we meet these distinguished guests from China. Since pandas are so rare, in order not to disturb the daily life of pandas, the daily exhibition time is limited to three hours. </p>
            <p>Here, tourists can not only feel the duty of protecting wild animals from those endangered species, but also get a glimpse from the neighboring marine aquarium, and from the neighbors of animals in crisis on land-marine animal partners. Silk of joy and relief. The situation in the animal world is just like two heavens, where a sharp contrast and sharp contrast are formed here, which is deafening.
