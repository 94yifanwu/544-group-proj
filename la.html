            <p class="lead">You've come to the right place if you only have 3 days in LA and are wondering where to start. I can give you some good advice and tips as a local for visiting the area. I will also help you prepare the ideal three-day itinerary for Los Angeles, which will leave you with plenty of wonderful memories.</p>
              <h4>3 Days Itenerary</h4>
              <h5>Day 1</h5>
              <p>Before you arrive in Los Angeles, you should book a place to stay. If you are interested in staying in a hotel, then I would recommend the Sheraton Gateway Los Angeles Hotel. What I like about this hotel is that it is 79 dollars a night, which is more on the inexpensive side of the hotels in Los Angeles. It is close to LAX, so you can arrive there early after leaving the airport and you can leave the hotel later than normal when you are leaving Los Angeles. This hotel also has a lot of great amenities, such as a pool, gym, breakfast and shuttle services.</p>

            <p>After getting off the airplane and checking into the hotel, you will most likely be hungry.  If you want to eat, then there are few restaurants nearby, which include Subway, Carl's Jr., Denny’s, and Taco Bell. The hotel also has a restaurant called Costero Bistro. This restaurant serves chicken wings, steak, pizzas, tacos, and more.
            </p>

            <p>On your first day in Los Angeles, I recommend visiting the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It costs $1.50 per hour to park in that area using meter parking. In the walk of fame, the sidewalk has the names of over 2,500 people who have achieved a lot of success in the film industry. These names include actors and directors. It is always fun recognizing a name.
            </p>

            <p>While at the Walk of Fame, I would recommend visiting the TCL Chinese Theatre. In front of the theatre, there are hand prints of various actors from various time periods. The actors include Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Brooks, Shelly Temple, and more. Viewing the handprints is free, but inside the theatre there is a 94 feet by 46 feet  IMAX screen with over 900 seats. The price of a ticket could be around 50 dollars, but I think it is worth it.
            </p>
              <div class="ftco-blocks-cover-1">
                  <div class="site-section-cover" data-stellar-background-ratio="0.5" style="background-image: url('images/la2.jpg')"></div>
              </div><p></p>
              <h5>Day 2</h5>
              <p>On your second day in Los Angeles, I recommend going to Universal Studios. Universal Studios is a theme park that has ten attractions. The price of a ticket can be between 99 dollars to 129 dollars, but I believe it is worth it.</p>
              <p>The first attraction I would recommend would be the Water World show. This is a 20 minute show that is full of amazing stunts. After that, I would go on the tram tour. In that tour you get to see sets where movies were filmed. In my opinion the most amazing set was the War of Worlds set, which was a crashed Boeing 747. This set was made using a real airplane and it looked very realistic. The next attraction I recommend is the Jurassic Park ride. The ride starts off slow and you see a lot of robotic dinosaurs. At the end of the ride you experience a fast drop that is 85 feet high. The next ride I would go on is the Transformer Ride. Throughout this ride you are moving around and watching characters from Transformers on screens that are battling each other and you feel that you are part of the action. The final ride I think you should go on is the Revenge of the Mummy. This ride is a rollercoaster that accelerates really fast at the start and continues to move as fast throughout the ride until it stops and then it moves backwards. Throughout the ride it is completely dark which adds to the excitement.

              <div class="site-section-cover" data-stellar-background-ratio="0.5" style="background-image: url('images/getty.jpg')"></div>
            </div><p></p>
              <h5>Day 3</h5>
            <p>On your last day in Los Angeles is the I recommend visiting the Getty Center. The Getty Center is an art museum with numerous pieces of art. The collection includes sculptures, paintings, manuscripts, and photographs. The collection is from various time periods, with the oldest pieces being over 2000 years old and the more recent pieces being from the 19th century.
            </p>
              <p>Going outside of the museum, you can experience the beautiful architecture of the museum. Since the Getty Center is on top of a hill, you can see amazing views of Los Angeles. There was a spot where I was able to see the ocean from the museum. There is a restaurant at the museum, but I felt that the prices were too expensive, so I would not recommend eating there. Before you get there you should go somewhere to eat, so you are not hungry during your visit at the museum. Entering the museum is free, but you may have to pay a parking fee of 20 dollars, which I find to be reasonable. You could also get there with an uber or lyft.
              </p>
