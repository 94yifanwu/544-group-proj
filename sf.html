              This 3 day itinerary and guide in San Francisco using both trip experiences, along with loads of research, covering the must-see, classic spots in the area, as well as discovering various neighborhoods and gems outside the tourist bubble. It's a busy itinerary, full of lots of walking (those SF hills are not a joke!), but it will give you the opportunity to experience many of the things that make San Francisco special.

            </p>
            <h4>How to get to San Francisco</h4>
            <p>You will either fly to San Francisco International Airport (SFO) or Oakland International Airport (OAK) when you fly to San Francisco.</p>
            <p>SFO is about 14 miles south of the town, and OAK is approximately 20 miles east of the town. SFO is much bigger and has many more airlines that fly in and out of the airport, but both airports are international and offer many flights. OAK also has a number of airlines, but there are a few larger airlines which do not operate in and out of Oakland, such as United and JetBlue.</p>
            <h4>Where to Stay</h4>
            <p>There are several choices for where you should stay for this 3-day itinerary in San Francisco. But we wanted to warn you before we dive into where to stay: San Francisco is pricey! The average room for a hotel is $200-$300 a night. While cheaper alternatives can certainly be found, many of the common areas come with a hefty price tag.</p>
            <p>There are some amazing Airbnb and hotel options. Airbnb's like Mission District, North beach and Hotels like Hotel Emblem or The westin union square.</p>

            <h4>3 Days Itenerary
            </h4>
            <h5>Day 1</h5>
            <p>When you think of San Francisco, the first day of this San Francisco itinerary hits up a lot of the key attractions you think of. For an authentic San Francisco experience and to save yourself time, we suggest taking the cable car when you can!</p>
            <p>Get an early start with breakfast at the Ferry Building. Take a scenic boat ride over to the island of Alcatraz. This 2.5 hour tour will take you across the water (the views are incredible!) to Alcatraz, where you will explore with a self-guided audio tour at your own pace. Make sure you book well ahead of time, spots will fill up!</p>
            <p>Visit the Coit Tower ($8). The line to get to the top can be long, but the view is awesome! See the sea lions (they're smelly, but so amusing!) at Fisherman's Wharf. The area is super touristy, but if it's your first time in town, you have to at least make a fast stop! Check out Ghirardelli Square when you are in the area and snag some chocolate samples.</p>
            <p>Chinatown Walk about. Be sure to stop for an egg tart at Golden Gate Bakery and go to Fortune Cookies at Golden Gate to see them make fortune cookies and even customize your own! Check out Local Version or Bourbon & Branch if you want to grab some drinks.</p>

            <h5>Day 2</h5>
            <p>Day two of this itinerary in San Francisco will take you to the city's coastal side, where you'll visit parks and see a lot of views of the Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
            <p>Walk across part (or all of the Golden Gate Bridge from Crissy Field. Go to the Marin Headlands, which in our opinion, has the best view of the Golden Gate Bridge (the second picture of the bridge above if you feel extra adventurous!</p>

            <h5>Day 3</h5>
            <p>The last day of this three-day itinerary in San Francisco takes you to more tourist spots, as well as discovering some of the local history and neighbourhoods of San Francisco. For pastries or for a more traditional breakfast, have breakfast at Tartine Bakery, head to Plow, Dottie's True Blue Cafe, or Washington Square's Mama's. All three of them are famous, so get in early!</p>
            <p>See the Painted Ladies, known for being used in Full House's opening credits. Roll around the neighborhood of Haight-Ashbury, which was the center of the Hippie movement of the 1960s. There are plenty of stores you can explore, including Amoeba Music.</p>
            <p>Walk through the District of the Mission to see all the murals. A reference to the murals can be found here. Stop by Mission Dolores Park for another fantastic view of the city while you are in the Mission District. This is also a terrific sunset spot!</p>
